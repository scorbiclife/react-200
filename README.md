# React 200

Exercises from the book "초보자를 위한 리액트 200제" (200 Exercises for React Beginners)

## Why

- Daily commit routine material
    - I wanted to maintain a consistent study schedule,
      and making it a routine to learn something and commit everyday seemed to matter.

- Building muscle memory for writing react code
    - I underestimated the importance of this
      but this surprisingly seemed to matter in a lot of contexts.
      I recently had a hard time following an online course because
      I had to multitask between learning what's taught in the course
      and actively thinking how I should write some react code.
